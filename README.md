TO DO (for the Universal version - Windows is deprecated)
* BUG: Don't allow schedules with a class that has, for example, no lab sections open
* Click on the calendar view to "lock" a course
* Make the boxes a little bigger, so it looks like you have more classes
* BUG: Include online courses (probably loaded similarly to appointment sections)
* Make the calendar the default view (as opposed to the detail view)
* BUG: Count courses with the same number but different names as separate courses
  * Test with KIN101
* BUG: Include whether something is an 8-week course
  * This information could be in the little info thing below the section, which isn't loaded right now
* Export as an Excel file (probably as a CSV), or allow printing the detail view
* Add check boxes to limit a section to only T/U or M/W/F
