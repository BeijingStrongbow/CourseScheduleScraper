TO DO (for the Universal version - Windows is deprecated)
* ~~BUG: Don't allow schedules with a class that has, for example, no lab sections open~~
* ~~Click on the calendar view to "lock" a course~~
* ~~Make the boxes a little bigger, so it looks like you have more classes~~
* ~~BUG: Include online courses (probably loaded similarly to appointment sections)~~
* ~~When you're on calendar "mode" or detail "mode," change the schedule being displayed when the selection changes~~
* ~~BUG: Count courses with the same number but different names as separate courses~~
  * ~~Test with KIN101~~
* BUG: Include whether something is an 8-week course
  * This information could be in the little info thing below the section, which isn't loaded right now
* Export as an Excel file (probably as a CSV), or allow printing the detail view
* Add check boxes to limit a section to only T/U or M/W/F
* ~~Make sure all sections for a course are the same color (including rec, lab, etc.)~~
* ~~Auto-update feature (probably pull the jar from github)~~
* ~~Allow using arrow keys to scroll between schedules~~
* ~~Keep the same colors for each class on every schedule option~~
* ~~Automatically clear example text from text fields when the user clicks on it~~
* ~~BUG: Fix the "URL could not be parsed" error so that it doesn't print to the console~~
* When a class has no lectures, it only shows "Recitation," which is confusing
  * E.g. ENGL100
